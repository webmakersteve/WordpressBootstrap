Boilerplate standards-compliant parent theme for making Bootstrap 3 WordPress themes.

As a often front-end developer, I need to make custom WordPress themes very often. A lot of them are built
on Bootstrap with custom CSS for branding, etc. Every time I make a site like this, I need to redo a lot of 
the work I have done in the past by making sidebars Bootstrap compliant, menus bootstrap-compliant, and a bunch
of other things. 

I'd like to take all of the work I've had to do and put it in one place for me and others to enjoy. In a place that
is very delete-key friendly. The structure is something that is generally required and similar for all sites (Sidebar
collapses to the bottom. Mobile menu pulls out from the side. Etc.) So I made a theme that takes these practices
and puts them into a theme that can be extended.

The themed styles can be completely removed by adding an easy PHP call so you don't need to worry about overriding every 
background-color or drop shadow used in the default implementation.
